    "info": " Kala Bhuno is a famous dark and tender dish native to Chittagong prepared with shoulder pieces of beef and traditional spices usually served during Mezban It was originally served during the early 17th century However the origin of the dish is unknown Bhuna (Chittagonian) means deep-fryin derived from Bhunna (Urdu) meaning to be fried and the word Kala means dark or black in Chittagonian.Natives of Chittagong used to cover their fried dark and tendered beef dish using banana leaves and packed it for long tours on foot nowadays aluminium foil is used instead of the traditional banana leaf. The first major innovation that led to what is now known as kala-bhuna was the use of special spices and the long frying technique. The dish was invented shortly as it was common for the people of the area around Chittagong to fry curried beef for an extended period in order to preserve it for a longer time. Kala bhuna is a delicacy in mezbans weddings eids and in sehri or iftar during the time of Ramadan"
